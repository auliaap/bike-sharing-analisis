The dataset used for this project is split into two parts:
hour.csv: Contains bike usage data per hour
day.csv: Contains bike usage data per day

Steps in Analysis:
-Data Wrangling
-Removed missing and duplicate data
-Handled outliers using IQR method.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Advanced Analysis
-Performed clustering on bike usage based on hours.
